After completing his higher education in his hometown, he decided to join Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. This is popularly known as RSS in our country. During his earlier ages of life, he was headstrong and was not that keen on the concept of marriage. Since then, he has dedicated his entire life to his motherland. At the age of 17, Narendra Modi decided to travel around the country and gain knowledge while helping others. Mr Modi is a great admirer of the ideologies of Swami Vivekananda.</p>
